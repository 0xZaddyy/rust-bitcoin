# BIP-0032 and BIP-0380

The current module has not been patched much in the last 5 years and the rest of the code base has
stylistically changed quite a bit.

* Re-write the BIP-0032 API
* Add support for BIP-0380

See [BIP-0032 super issue](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/issues/4770).
